The Online Exam System is a system in which Students can take the exam online easily and the exam administrators can manage the student information and the exam results.
- On **the student’s webpage side**, there are the _“Login”_ page, the _“Rules & Regulations”_ page, the _“System compatibility check”_ page, the _“User face input collection”_ page, the _“Exam”_ page, and the _“Result”_ page.
- On **the admin’s webpage side**, there is the _“Students Listing”_ page (CRUD process of students can be performed) and the _“Exam Results”_ page (Each Student Result Status and Total Score can be reviewed)
- Developed the system using `Flask Framework` and `MySQL Database`.
